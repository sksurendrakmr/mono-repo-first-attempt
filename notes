1. yarn init --y

2. # we need learna package

   yarn add --dev lerna

   \*\* Lerna is going to give us some useful commands to help us
   publish our packages to NPM easily, commits and pushing and etc.

   We use lerna in combination with yarn workspaces

3. To initialize new lerna project

   yarn lerna init

"private":true ==> This way lerna get to know that this is a private package thats not
going to be published
It is just a package that is used to manage the workspace.

"npmClient": "yarn" ==> Inform lerna that we are using yarn as workspace
"stream": true ==> show logs
